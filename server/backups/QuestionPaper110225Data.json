The pollen tube grows from the pollen grain to reach the ovule. Fertilization occurs when the male gamete fuses with the female gamete to form a zygote. The zygote develops into a seed, which is contained within a fruit. This process ensures genetic variation in the offspring.",

    "answer": "The menstrual cycle in females is controlled by hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH). The cycle consists of several phases including the follicular phase, ovulation, and luteal phase. During the follicular phase, FSH stimulates the growth of follicles in the ovary, which produce estrogen. Estrogen causes the lining of the uterus to thicken in preparation for a possible pregnancy. Ovulation occurs when the mature egg is released from the ovary. The luteal phase is characterized by the release of progesterone, which helps maintain the uterine lining. If fertilization does not occur, estrogen and progesterone levels decrease, leading to menstruation. These hormones play a crucial role in regulating the menstrual cycle and preparing the body for pregnancy.",

Mathematically, electric flux = E * A * cos(theta), where E is the electric field, A is the area vector, and theta is the angle between the electric field and the area vector. Gauss's law relates the total electric flux through a closed surface to the charge enclosed within that surface.

    "answer": "Living things have several distinct characteristics that set them apart from non-living things:\n\n1. Need for Food:\n- All living things need food for energy and growth\n- Plants make their food through photosynthesis\n- Animals obtain food by eating plants or other animals\n\n2. Respiration:\n- Living things take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide\n- Plants respire through leaves\n- Animals use different organs like lungs or gills\n\n3. Growth and Development:\n- Living things increase in size and complexity\n- Example: A seed growing into a plant\n- Animals grow from babies to adults\n\n4. Response to Stimuli:\n- Living things react to changes in environment\n- Plants bend towards sunlight\n- Animals respond to touch, sound, and light\n\n5. Reproduction:\n- Living things produce offspring of their kind\n- Plants reproduce through seeds or vegetatively\n- Animals reproduce through eggs or giving birth\n\n6. Movement:\n- All living things show some form of movement\n- Plants show growth movements\n- Animals can move from place to place\n\nThese characteristics help us identify and classify living things in our environment.",

    "answer": "The Earth has two main motions: rotation and revolution. Rotation is the spinning of the Earth on its axis, which takes about 24 hours and causes day and night. Revolution is the movement of the Earth around the Sun, which takes about 365.25 days and causes the change of seasons. The Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees, which results in varying lengths of day and night and different seasons in different parts of the world. For example, when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, it experiences summer, while the Southern Hemisphere experiences winter. These motions are fundamental to the Earth's climate and life cycles.",

    "answer": "Teeth play a crucial role in the process of digestion by breaking down the food into smaller pieces. The front teeth, called incisors, are used for cutting and biting the food. The pointed teeth, called canines, help in tearing and shredding the food. The premolars and molars at the back of the mouth are used for grinding and crushing the food into smaller particles. This mechanical digestion by the teeth increases the surface area of the food, making it easier for the enzymes in the digestive system to break it down further.",

    "answer": "Reproduction in plants can occur through both sexual and asexual means. In sexual reproduction, plants produce flowers that contain reproductive organs. The male reproductive organ is the stamen, which consists of the anther and filament, while the female reproductive organ is the pistil, which consists of the stigma, style, and ovary. Pollination occurs when pollen from the anther is transferred to the stigma, either by wind, insects, or other means. This leads to fertilization, where the pollen travels down the style to the ovary and fertilizes the ovule, forming a seed. In asexual reproduction, plants can reproduce through methods like runners, bulbs, tubers, or cutting, where new plants are produced without the need for seeds.",

    "answer": "Respiration in organisms is the process of taking in oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide. It involves two main stages - inhalation and exhalation. During inhalation, organisms take in oxygen-rich air, which is then transported to the cells in the body. In the cells, oxygen is used to break down glucose molecules to release energy in the form of ATP. This process is called cellular respiration. The waste product, carbon dioxide, is then carried back to the lungs and expelled from the body during exhalation.",

These layers differ in composition, temperature, and physical state, playing crucial roles in the Earth's structure and dynamics.",

Near the surface of the Earth, its value is approximately 9.81 m/s². This means that an object in free fall near the Earth's surface will accelerate at a rate of 9.81 m/s². \n\nThe acceleration due to gravity varies with altitude and depth. As we go higher above the Earth's surface, the value of acceleration due to gravity decreases. This is because the distance between the object and the center of the Earth increases, resulting in a weaker gravitational force. Similarly, as we go deeper below the Earth's surface, the value of acceleration due to gravity also decreases due to the reduced mass of the Earth below the object. However, these variations are relatively small and can be considered constant for most practical purposes.",

When an electron jumps from one orbit to another, energy is absorbed or emitted.

The eardrum vibrates in response to the sound waves, which then transmit the vibrations to three tiny bones in the middle ear called the hammer, anvil, and stirrup. These bones amplify the vibrations and transmit them to the cochlea in the inner ear. The cochlea is filled with fluid and lined with tiny hair cells that convert the vibrations into electrical signals. These signals are then sent to the brain via the auditory nerve, where they are interpreted as sound.",

The overall charge of the atom is neutral due to the equal amount of positive and negative charges.

It occurs at the surface of the liquid when the kinetic energy of the molecules is high enough to overcome the intermolecular forces holding them together. For example, when water is left in an open container, it slowly evaporates over time. \n\nOne key difference between evaporation and boiling is that evaporation occurs at all temperatures, while boiling specifically happens at the boiling point of a substance. Boiling is a rapid process that occurs throughout the liquid, leading to the formation of bubbles, whereas evaporation is a slower process that takes place only at the surface of the liquid.",

Meristematic tissue is responsible for cell division and growth in plants. Permanent tissue can be further classified into simple permanent tissue (consisting of parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma cells) and complex permanent tissue (xylem and phloem). Parenchyma cells store food, provide support, and help in photosynthesis. Collenchyma cells provide mechanical support to young plant parts. Sclerenchyma cells provide rigidity and strength to the plant. Xylem transports water and minerals, while phloem transports food. Protective tissue includes epidermis and periderm, which protect the plant from physical damage and prevent water loss.",

    "answer": "The five kingdom classification system was proposed by R.H. Whittaker in 1969. It categorizes all living organisms into five kingdoms based on certain characteristics. The five kingdoms are Monera (bacteria), Protista (algae, protozoans), Fungi (yeasts, molds), Plantae (plants), and Animalia (animals). Each kingdom represents a group of organisms that share common characteristics. Monera includes unicellular prokaryotic organisms, Protista includes unicellular eukaryotic organisms, Fungi are multicellular eukaryotic organisms that absorb nutrients, Plantae are multicellular autotrophic organisms, and Animalia are multicellular heterotrophic organisms. This classification system helps in organizing and studying the vast diversity of living organisms on Earth.",

    "answer": "Mixed cropping is a farming practice where two or more crops are grown simultaneously in the same field. This method helps in reducing the risk of total crop failure as different crops have different requirements and are resistant to different pests and diseases. Additionally, mixed cropping increases the overall productivity of the land as it maximizes the use of available resources like sunlight, water, and nutrients. It also helps in improving soil fertility by fixing nitrogen in the soil. Moreover, mixed cropping can provide a variety of crops for consumption, thereby ensuring food security and increasing income for farmers. Overall, mixed cropping is an efficient and sustainable agricultural practice that offers numerous benefits to farmers and the environment.",

The main functions of the cell membrane include regulating the passage of substances in and out of the cell, maintaining the cell's shape and integrity, and facilitating cell communication. The phospholipid bilayer provides a barrier that separates the internal environment of the cell from the external environment, allowing only certain molecules to pass through. The proteins in the membrane help in transporting molecules, cell recognition, and cell signaling. Overall, the cell membrane plays a crucial role in the survival and functioning of a cell.",

    "answer": "Inertia is the tendency of an object to resist any change in its motion. An object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue to move at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. For example, when a moving bus suddenly stops, the passengers lurch forward due to their inertia. Similarly, when a ball is rolled on a flat surface, it eventually comes to a stop due to the force of friction overcoming its inertia. Inertia is directly related to Newton's First Law of Motion, which states that an object will remain in its state of motion unless acted upon by an external force.",

    "answer": "In physics, work is defined as the product of the force applied on an object and the distance over which the force is applied. Mathematically, work (W) = force (F) x distance (d) moved in the direction of the force. For example, when a person lifts a box from the ground to a shelf, work is done against the force of gravity. Another example is pushing a car to move it. In both cases, work is done when a force is exerted over a distance. Work is a scalar quantity and its SI unit is joules (J). It is important to note that work is only done when there is a displacement caused by the force applied.",

    "answer": "Evolution by natural selection is a process where organisms that are better adapted to their environment tend to survive and reproduce more than those that are less adapted. This leads to the gradual change in a population over generations. For example, in the case of the peppered moth during the Industrial Revolution in England, the light-colored moths were camouflaged against lichen-covered trees. However, with industrialization and pollution, the trees became darkened, making the light-colored moths more visible to predators. As a result, the darker-colored moths had a survival advantage and their population increased, leading to a shift in the moth population from predominantly light-colored to predominantly dark-colored. This is an example of evolution by natural selection where the environment plays a significant role in determining the survival and reproduction of organisms.",

    "answer": "The laws of reflection state that: 1. The incident ray, the reflected ray, and the normal to the surface of the mirror at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane. 2. The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. This means that the angle between the incident ray and the normal is equal to the angle between the reflected ray and the normal. To understand this better, consider a mirror and a ray of light incident on it. The incident ray strikes the mirror surface at a point called the point of incidence. The normal is an imaginary line perpendicular to the surface of the mirror at the point of incidence. The angle between the incident ray and the normal is the angle of incidence, and the angle between the reflected ray and the normal is the angle of reflection. These two angles are equal according to the laws of reflection. This phenomenon can be better understood with the help of a diagram showing the incident ray, normal, reflected ray, and angles of incidence and reflection.",

    "answer": "Respiration in human beings is a vital process that involves the exchange of gases to provide oxygen for cellular respiration and remove carbon dioxide. It occurs in two stages: external respiration and internal respiration. External respiration involves the exchange of gases between the lungs and blood, where oxygen is taken in and carbon dioxide is released. Internal respiration takes place at the cellular level, where oxygen is used for the oxidation of food molecules to release energy, and carbon dioxide is produced as a byproduct. The respiratory system, including the nose, trachea, bronchi, and lungs, plays a crucial role in this process by facilitating the intake of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide. Overall, respiration is essential for the survival of human beings as it provides the necessary energy for various life processes.",

In other words, if a charge of one Coulomb passes through a conductor in one second, then the current flowing through it is one Ampere. Electric current is similar to the flow of water in a pipe, where the amount of water flowing per unit time is the flow rate. Similarly, in electric circuits, the amount of charge passing through a point per unit time is the electric current.

The male gamete travels through the pollen tube to reach the female gamete for fertilization, resulting in the formation of a zygote. The zygote develops into a seed, and the ovule develops into a fruit.",

One example of coordination in plants is phototropism, where plants bend towards a source of light. This response is mediated by the hormone auxin, which is produced in the shoot tip and moves towards the shaded side of the plant, causing elongation of cells on that side and bending of the plant towards the light. This process involves a series of signal transduction pathways and coordination between different plant parts to ensure an effective response. Overall, coordination in plants helps in their survival and adaptation to changing environmental conditions.",

It begins with the production of gametes through meiosis in the gonads - testes in males and ovaries in females. During sexual intercourse, sperm from the male is deposited in the female reproductive tract, where it travels towards the egg. Fertilization occurs when a sperm cell penetrates the egg cell, forming a zygote. The zygote undergoes cell division and develops into an embryo, which eventually grows into a fetus. The fetus is nourished by the mother through the placenta. The process of human sexual reproduction ensures genetic variation in offspring and is essential for the continuity of the species.",

When an action potential reaches the axon terminal of a neuron, it triggers the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.

This binding leads to the generation of a new electrical signal in the postsynaptic neuron, continuing the transmission of the nerve impulse.",

    "answer": "Essential minerals play a crucial role in the growth and development of plants. These minerals are required in specific amounts for various physiological functions. Macronutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are essential for plant growth, photosynthesis, and overall metabolism. Micronutrients like iron, zinc, and manganese are also important for enzyme activation, hormone synthesis, and overall plant health. Deficiency of any essential mineral can lead to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and even death of the plant. To ensure proper plant nutrition, it is essential to provide a balanced supply of all essential minerals through the soil or foliar application. Monitoring the nutrient levels and adjusting fertilization practices accordingly is key to ensuring optimal plant growth and productivity.",

Ligaments, on the other hand, are also tough, fibrous connective tissues that connect bones to other bones. They provide stability to joints and prevent excessive movement, helping in maintaining proper alignment and coordination during physical activities.",

Dendrites receive signals from other neurons and transmit them towards the cell body. The axon transmits signals away from the cell body to other neurons or effector cells. Neurons function by transmitting electrical and chemical signals, allowing communication within the nervous system.",

Algae can be unicellular, colonial, or multicellular. They reproduce through spores, fragmentation, or sexual reproduction. Some examples of algae include: 1. Green algae - like Spirogyra, Chlamydomonas, and Ulva. 2. Brown algae - like Sargassum and Laminaria. 3. Red algae - like Porphyra and Gelidium. 4. Diatoms - like Navicula and Coscinodiscus. 5. Blue-green algae - like Nostoc and Anabaena. Algae play a crucial role in the ecosystem by producing oxygen through photosynthesis and serving as a food source for various aquatic organisms.",

    "options": [],
    "marks": 4,
    "answer": "The nephron is the structural and functional unit of the human excretory system. It consists of two main parts - the renal corpuscle and the renal tubule. The renal corpuscle includes the glomerulus, a network of capillaries, and the Bowman's capsule, a cup-shaped structure that surrounds the glomerulus. The renal tubule consists of the proximal convoluted tubule, loop of Henle, distal convoluted tubule, and collecting duct. \n\nThe functions of the nephron include filtration, reabsorption, secretion, and excretion. Filtration occurs in the glomerulus, where blood is filtered to form the glomerular filtrate. Reabsorption takes place in the renal tubule, where essential substances like glucose, amino acids, and water are reabsorbed back into the blood. Secretion involves the transfer of waste products from the blood into the tubule. Excretion is the final process where the urine is formed and expelled from the body. Overall, the nephron plays a crucial role in maintaining the body's internal environment by regulating the composition and volume of body fluids.",

    "answer": "During inhalation, the diaphragm contracts and moves downwards while the intercostal muscles contract, causing the rib cage to move up and out. This increases the volume of the thoracic cavity, leading to a decrease in pressure inside the lungs. As a result, air rushes into the lungs from the atmosphere. During exhalation, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax. The diaphragm moves upwards and the rib cage moves downwards and inwards, decreasing the volume of the thoracic cavity. This increase in pressure inside the lungs forces the air to move out of the lungs into the atmosphere. This process of inhalation and exhalation facilitates the exchange of gases, allowing oxygen to enter the bloodstream and carbon dioxide to be expelled.",

    "marks": 4,
    "answer": "The sliding filament theory of muscle contraction explains how muscles generate force and movement. According to this theory, during muscle contraction, the thin actin filaments slide over the thick myosin filaments, causing the sarcomere (the basic unit of muscle contraction) to shorten. This process is initiated by the binding of calcium ions to troponin, which causes tropomyosin to move away from the binding sites on actin, allowing myosin heads to attach to actin. ATP hydrolysis then powers the movement of myosin heads, pulling the actin filaments towards the center of the sarcomere. This repeated cycle of attachment, power stroke, and detachment results in muscle contraction. Once the stimulation stops, calcium ions are pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, tropomyosin covers the binding sites on actin, and the muscle relaxes.",

This process ensures the coordinated development of both the embryo and endosperm, essential for the growth and survival of the plant.

It begins in the nephrons of the kidneys where blood is filtered to form a filtrate containing water, glucose, ions, urea, and other waste products. This filtrate then moves to the renal tubules where selective reabsorption occurs. Essential substances like glucose, ions, and water are reabsorbed back into the blood while waste products like urea, excess ions, and drugs are left in the tubules. Finally, secretion takes place where additional waste products are actively transported from the blood into the tubules. The remaining fluid is concentrated and forms urine, which is eventually excreted from the body through the urethra.",

    "marks": 4,
    "answer": "The transmission of nerve impulse across a chemical synapse involves several steps. When the action potential reaches the axon terminal, it triggers the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels. The influx of calcium ions causes synaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitters to fuse with the presynaptic membrane and release the neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitters then bind to specific receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, leading to depolarization of the postsynaptic neuron. This depolarization may trigger an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron, continuing the signal transmission. The neurotransmitters are either broken down by enzymes or taken back up into the presynaptic neuron through reuptake. Overall, the process ensures the unidirectional flow of nerve impulses across the synapse.",

Phagocytosis is the engulfing of solid particles, pinocytosis is the engulfing of liquid particles, and receptor-mediated endocytosis involves the binding of specific molecules to receptors on the cell membrane. Once the material is engulfed, the vesicle fuses with a lysosome where the contents are digested. Endocytosis is essential for nutrient uptake, immune response, and maintaining cellular homeostasis.",

It is essential for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction in organisms. The process of mitosis consists of several stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. During prophase, the chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes, the nuclear membrane breaks down, and spindle fibers begin to form. In metaphase, the chromosomes line up along the cell's equator. In anaphase, the sister chromatids are pulled apart and move towards opposite poles of the cell. Finally, in telophase, the chromosomes reach the poles, the nuclear membrane reforms, and the cell undergoes cytokinesis to divide into two daughter cells.",

The electrons are then transferred through a series of proteins in the electron transport chain, creating a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. This gradient drives ATP synthesis through ATP synthase. At the end of the chain, the electrons combine with NADP+ and H+ ions to form NADPH, a high-energy electron carrier.",

    "answer": "Transpiration is the process by which water is lost from a plant through the stomata in the leaves. It occurs mainly through the leaves, but can also take place through the stems and flowers. Transpiration helps in the movement of water and minerals from the roots to the leaves and other parts of the plant. The water is absorbed by the roots from the soil and is transported through the xylem tissue to the leaves. Once in the leaves, water evaporates into the air through small pores called stomata. This loss of water creates a negative pressure in the xylem, which helps in the upward movement of water. Transpiration also helps in cooling the plant and maintaining its temperature. Overall, transpiration plays a crucial role in the overall water balance and nutrient transport in plants.",

    "answer": "Absorption of digested food in the small intestine is a complex process that involves various mechanisms. The inner surface of the small intestine is covered with millions of tiny finger-like projections called villi, which increase the surface area for absorption. Each villus has a network of blood capillaries and a lymphatic vessel called lacteal. \n\nThe absorption of different nutrients occurs through different mechanisms. Carbohydrates and proteins are absorbed into the blood capillaries, while fats are absorbed into the lacteals. The absorption of water and minerals also takes place in the small intestine. \n\nThe absorbed nutrients are then transported to the liver via the hepatic portal vein, where they are further processed before being distributed to the rest of the body. Overall, the small intestine plays a crucial role in the efficient absorption of nutrients from the digested food.",

It consists of several stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. \n\nDuring prophase, the chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes, the nuclear envelope breaks down, and the mitotic spindle forms. In metaphase, the chromosomes align at the metaphase plate. During anaphase, the sister chromatids separate and move towards opposite poles of the cell. Finally, in telophase, the chromosomes de-condense, the nuclear envelope reforms, and the spindle fibers disassemble. \n\nCytokinesis, which is the division of the cytoplasm, usually occurs after mitosis, resulting in two genetically identical daughter cells. Mitosis plays a crucial role in growth, development, and tissue repair in multicellular organisms.",

This energy is used to split water molecules into oxygen, protons, and electrons. The electrons are then transferred through a series of proteins in the electron transport chain, generating ATP and NADPH.\n\nIn the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle), ATP and NADPH produced in the light-dependent reactions are used to convert carbon dioxide into glucose. This process involves a series of enzyme-controlled reactions that take place in the stroma of the chloroplasts.Overall, photosynthesis is a crucial process for the survival of plants as it provides them with the energy they need to grow and reproduce.",

    "answer": "Aerobic respiration in plants is the process by which cells break down glucose in the presence of oxygen to produce energy, carbon dioxide, and water. The process can be broken down into three main stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. In glycolysis, glucose is broken down into pyruvate molecules, producing a small amount of ATP. The pyruvate then enters the mitochondria where it is further broken down in the Krebs cycle, producing more ATP and carbon dioxide. Finally, in the electron transport chain, the high-energy electrons from the Krebs cycle are used to create a large amount of ATP. Overall, aerobic respiration is a highly efficient process that provides plants with the energy they need to carry out various cellular functions.",

When a sperm penetrates the egg, it triggers changes in the egg that prevent other sperm from entering. The genetic material from the sperm and egg then combine to form a diploid zygote. The zygote undergoes multiple rounds of cell division to form a blastocyst, which then implants itself in the endometrium of the uterus. This marks the beginning of pregnancy. The process of fertilization ensures genetic diversity and the continuation of the species.",

It helps in preventing infectious diseases by creating an immune response without causing the disease itself. Immunization is crucial as it helps in reducing the spread of diseases, protecting individuals from serious illnesses, and even eradicating certain diseases. Vaccines have played a significant role in controlling diseases like smallpox, polio, measles, etc. They work by introducing a weakened or inactive form of the pathogen into the body, triggering the immune system to produce antibodies. These antibodies provide immunity against future infections by the same pathogen. Overall, immunization is a cost-effective and life-saving public health intervention that has had a profound impact on global health.",

For example, penicillin, one of the first antibiotics discovered, is produced by the fungus Penicillium. This process of using microbes for antibiotic production has revolutionized medicine and has led to the development of various life-saving drugs.",

This leads to the accumulation of favorable traits in a population over time. An example of natural selection is the peppered moth during the Industrial Revolution in England. As the environment became polluted, the light-colored moths stood out against darkened trees, making them more vulnerable to predators. The dark-colored moths had higher survival rates as they were better camouflaged, leading to an increase in their population.",

    "answer": "Fertilization in humans is the process where the sperm cell from the male fuses with the egg cell from the female to form a zygote. It occurs in the fallopian tube of the female reproductive system. After sexual intercourse, the sperm travels through the cervix and uterus to reach the fallopian tube where the egg is released during ovulation. The sperm penetrates the egg's outer layer (zona pellucida) and fertilizes it, resulting in the formation of a zygote. The zygote then undergoes multiple cell divisions to form an embryo, which eventually implants in the uterus for further development. This process marks the beginning of a new individual with a unique genetic composition.",

It is the process by which organisms that are better adapted to their environment tend to survive and reproduce more. This leads to the passing on of beneficial traits to the next generation, resulting in the evolution of a population. For example, the peppered moth in England during the Industrial Revolution. Prior to industrialization, light-colored moths were well camouflaged against lichen-covered tree trunks. But with the increase of pollution, darker moths had better camouflage and their population increased. This example illustrates how natural selection can lead to changes in a population over time.",

    "answer": "Population growth refers to the change in the number of individuals in a population over time. It can follow different patterns such as exponential growth, logistic growth, and oscillations. Exponential growth occurs when resources are unlimited, and the population grows at a constant rate. Logistic growth is when a population initially grows exponentially but then levels off due to limited resources. Oscillations refer to fluctuations in population size over time. Factors like birth rate, death rate, immigration, and emigration influence population growth. Understanding these patterns is crucial for predicting how populations will change in response to environmental factors.",

This means that the inheritance of one trait does not affect the inheritance of another trait. This principle was proposed by Gregor Mendel based on his experiments with dihybrid crosses. \n\nThe significance of independent assortment in genetics is that it helps in explaining the variety of traits observed in offspring. It also allows for the creation of genetic diversity in populations, which is important for evolution. Independent assortment is a key factor in genetic recombination, leading to new combinations of alleles and increasing genetic variability. Overall, the principle of independent assortment plays a crucial role in understanding genetic inheritance and diversity.",

DNA polymerase I removes the RNA primers and replaces them with DNA. DNA ligase then joins the Okazaki fragments. The process is semi-conservative, meaning each daughter DNA molecule consists of one parental strand and one newly synthesized strand.",

Pioneer stage: This is the initial stage where hardy and fast-growing species colonize the barren environment. \n\n2. Intermediate stage: As the pioneer species grow and die, they create soil and provide nutrients for other species to establish themselves. \n\n3.

During sexual intercourse, millions of sperm are deposited in the female reproductive tract. The sperm swim towards the egg, aided by cervical mucus and contractions of the female reproductive tract. Once a sperm successfully penetrates the egg's outer layer, the egg undergoes changes to prevent entry of other sperm. The genetic material from the sperm and egg then combine to form a zygote, which begins to divide and develop into an embryo.",

They were intermediaries between the British authorities and the Indian peasants, responsible for collecting revenue from the peasants on behalf of the British. Zamindars were often given large landholdings as a reward for their loyalty to the British, and they exploited the peasants by charging exorbitant rents and taxes. This system made zamindars powerful landlords who controlled large portions of land and wealth, further marginalizing the peasants in the countryside.",

An example is the marginalisation of indigenous people in many countries, who are often not given a voice in decision-making processes.",

    "answer": "Marginalisation can have a detrimental impact on the overall development of a society in various ways. When certain groups are excluded or discriminated against, it hinders the social cohesion and harmony within the society, leading to conflicts and unrest. For example, the marginalisation of ethnic minorities in some countries has resulted in violence and civil wars, hampering the development of those societies. Moreover, marginalised groups often lack access to resources, opportunities, and basic services, which perpetuates a cycle of poverty and underdevelopment. This can be seen in the case of marginalized communities in developing countries, where lack of education and healthcare facilities further exacerbates their marginalised status, hindering the overall progress of the society.",

It consists of a long glass tube with a very fine bore\n2. The tube contains mercury in a bulb at one end\n3. It has a scale ranging from 35°C to 42°C\n4. There is a kink or constriction near the bulb\n5. The thermometer has numbers and markings for accurate reading\n\nWorking:\n1. When the bulb is placed under the tongue, mercury expands due to body heat\n2. The mercury rises through the narrow bore\n3. The kink prevents mercury from falling back immediately\n4. After taking the reading, the thermometer is shaken to return mercury to the bulb\n\nReplacement of Mercury:\nMercury is being replaced because:\n1. It is toxic and harmful if the thermometer breaks\n2. Mercury contamination can harm the environment\n3. Mercury disposal is difficult and expensive\n\nModern Alternatives:\n1. Digital thermometers using electronic sensors\n2. Infrared thermometers for contactless measurement\n3. Alcohol-based thermometers which are safer and eco-friendly",

    "answer": "Temperature is a measure of how hot or cold an object is, determined by the average kinetic energy of its particles.\n\nConstruction of a Clinical Thermometer:\n1. It consists of a long glass tube with a very fine bore\n2. The tube contains mercury in a bulb at one end\n3. It has a scale ranging from 35°C to 42°C\n4. There is a kink or constriction near the bulb\n5. The thermometer has numbers and markings for accurate reading\n\nWorking:\n1. When the bulb is placed under the tongue, mercury expands due to body heat\n2. The mercury rises through the narrow bore\n3. The kink prevents mercury from falling back immediately\n4. After taking the reading, the thermometer is shaken to return mercury to the bulb\n\nReplacement of Mercury:\nMercury is being replaced because:\n1. It is toxic and harmful if the thermometer breaks\n2. Mercury contamination can harm the environment\n3. Mercury disposal is difficult and expensive\n\nModern Alternatives:\n1. Digital thermometers using electronic sensors\n2. Infrared thermometers for contactless measurement\n3. Alcohol-based thermometers which are safer and eco-friendly",

    "answer": "Longitude and latitude are imaginary lines on the Earth's surface used to locate places. Latitude lines run parallel to the equator, measuring the distance north or south of the equator. Longitude lines run from the North Pole to the South Pole, measuring the distance east or west of the Prime Meridian. By using the coordinates of latitude and longitude, we can precisely pinpoint any location on Earth. For example, if a place has a latitude of 40° N and a longitude of 100° E, it means it is 40 degrees north of the equator and 100 degrees east of the Prime Meridian. This system helps in navigation, mapping, and finding specific locations on the globe.",

    "options": [],
    "marks": 4,
    "answer": "The theory of continental drift, proposed by Alfred Wegener, suggests that the continents were once joined together in a single landmass called Pangaea. Over millions of years, the continents drifted apart to their current positions. This movement of continents has had a significant impact on the formation of oceans and continents. As the continents moved, new oceans were formed by the process of seafloor spreading at mid-ocean ridges. This movement also led to the formation of mountain ranges and deep ocean trenches. The concept of continental drift explains the similarities in rock formations, fossils, and geological features found on different continents. Overall, continental drift has played a crucial role in shaping the Earth's landmasses and oceans as we see them today.",

This system made zamindars powerful landlords who controlled large portions of land and wealth, further marginalizing the peasants in the countryside.",

They were often forced to work as labourers in the forests or in mines, where they were paid very low wages. The British government imposed various restrictions on their traditional practices like shifting cultivation, hunting, and gathering forest produce. The tribal people were also exploited by moneylenders who charged high interest rates. Additionally, they were sometimes displaced from their lands for various development projects like building railways or dams. These problems led to a loss of livelihood and cultural identity for the tribal communities.",
