During sexual intercourse, millions of sperm are deposited in the female reproductive tract. The sperm swim towards the egg, aided by cervical mucus and contractions of the female reproductive tract. Once a sperm successfully penetrates the egg's outer layer, the egg undergoes changes to prevent entry of other sperm. The genetic material from the sperm and egg then combine to form a zygote, which begins to divide and develop into an embryo."

It occurs in the fallopian tube of the female reproductive system. After sexual intercourse, the sperm travels through the cervix and uterus to reach the fallopian tube where the egg is released during ovulation. The sperm penetrates the egg's outer layer (zona pellucida) and fertilizes it, resulting in the formation of a zygote. The zygote then undergoes multiple cell divisions to form an embryo, which eventually implants in the uterus for further development. This process marks the beginning of a new individual with a unique genetic composition."

It also allows for the creation of genetic diversity in populations, which is important for evolution. Independent assortment is a key factor in genetic recombination, leading to new combinations of alleles and increasing genetic variability. Overall, the principle of independent assortment plays a crucial role in understanding genetic inheritance and diversity."

Primase synthesizes RNA primers, which are then extended by DNA polymerase III. Leading strand synthesis is continuous, while lagging strand synthesis is discontinuous, forming Okazaki fragments. DNA polymerase I removes the RNA primers and replaces them with DNA. DNA ligase then joins the Okazaki fragments. The process is semi-conservative, meaning each daughter DNA molecule consists of one parental strand and one newly synthesized strand."

It is the process by which organisms that are better adapted to their environment tend to survive and reproduce more. This leads to the passing on of beneficial traits to the next generation, resulting in the evolution of a population. For example, the peppered moth in England during the Industrial Revolution. Prior to industrialization, light-colored moths were well camouflaged against lichen-covered tree trunks. But with the increase of pollution, darker moths had better camouflage and their population increased. This example illustrates how natural selection can lead to changes in a population over time."
