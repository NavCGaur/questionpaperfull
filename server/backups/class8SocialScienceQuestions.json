Economic marginalisation occurs when certain groups are denied access to resources and opportunities, leading to poverty and lack of development. For instance, tribal communities in many countries are economically marginalised. Political marginalisation involves the denial of political rights and representation to certain groups. An example is the marginalisation of indigenous people in many countries, who are often not given a voice in decision-making processes."

Moreover, marginalised groups often lack access to resources, opportunities, and basic services, which perpetuates a cycle of poverty and underdevelopment.
