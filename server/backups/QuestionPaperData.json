    "answer": "The menstrual cycle in females is controlled by hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH). The cycle consists of several phases including the follicular phase, ovulation, and luteal phase. During the follicular phase, FSH stimulates the growth of follicles in the ovary, which produce estrogen. Estrogen causes the lining of the uterus to thicken in preparation for a possible pregnancy. Ovulation occurs when the mature egg is released from the ovary. The luteal phase is characterized by the release of progesterone, which helps maintain the uterine lining. If fertilization does not occur, estrogen and progesterone levels decrease, leading to menstruation. These hormones play a crucial role in regulating the menstrual cycle and preparing the body for pregnancy.",

The female gamete is the ovule, which is contained within the ovary. Pollination occurs when the pollen grain lands on the stigma of the flower. The pollen tube grows from the pollen grain to reach the ovule. Fertilization occurs when the male gamete fuses with the female gamete to form a zygote. The zygote develops into a seed, which is contained within a fruit. This process ensures genetic variation in the offspring.",

    "answer": "Electric flux is a measure of the flow of electric field through a given area. It is defined as the dot product of the electric field and the area vector. Mathematically, electric flux = E * A * cos(theta), where E is the electric field, A is the area vector, and theta is the angle between the electric field and the area vector. Gauss's law relates the total electric flux through a closed surface to the charge enclosed within that surface. It states that the total electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the total charge enclosed by the surface divided by the permittivity of free space. This law is used to calculate electric fields in symmetric charge distributions and understand the behavior of electric fields in various situations.",

    "answer": "The Earth has two main motions: rotation and revolution. Rotation is the spinning of the Earth on its axis, which takes about 24 hours and causes day and night. Revolution is the movement of the Earth around the Sun, which takes about 365.25 days and causes the change of seasons. The Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees, which results in varying lengths of day and night and different seasons in different parts of the world. For example, when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, it experiences summer, while the Southern Hemisphere experiences winter. These motions are fundamental to the Earth's climate and life cycles.",

    "answer": "Maps are essential tools in geography as they provide a visual representation of the Earth's surface. They help in understanding the location, size, and distribution of physical and human features. There are different types of maps, such as political maps, physical maps, and thematic maps, each serving a specific purpose. Symbols are used to represent features like rivers, mountains, and cities, while scales indicate the ratio between distances on the map and actual distances on the ground. Maps are used in navigation, urban planning, and education, making them indispensable for studying and interacting with the world.",

    "answer": "The Earth consists of four major domains: the lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere. The lithosphere is the solid outer layer of the Earth, including the crust and upper mantle. The hydrosphere comprises all water bodies, such as oceans, rivers, and lakes. The atmosphere is the layer of gases surrounding the Earth, providing air and regulating temperature. The biosphere includes all living organisms and their interactions with the other domains. These domains are interconnected and support life. For example, the lithosphere provides land for habitats, the hydrosphere supplies water, the atmosphere provides air, and the biosphere includes all life forms that depend on these resources. Human activities, such as deforestation and pollution, disrupt these interactions, highlighting the need for sustainable practices.",

    "options": [],
    "marks": 4,
    "answer": "The major landforms of the Earth include mountains, plateaus, plains, and valleys. Mountains are formed by tectonic forces that push the Earth's crust upwards. Plateaus are elevated flatlands formed by volcanic activity or erosion. Plains are low-lying areas formed by the deposition of sediments by rivers. Valleys are created by the erosion of land by rivers or glaciers. Internal forces, such as tectonic movements and volcanic activity, shape the Earth's surface by creating and altering landforms. External forces, such as weathering, erosion, and deposition, modify these landforms over time. Together, these forces create the diverse landscapes we see today.",
